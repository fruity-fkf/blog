      <description>HOI So this is just a small list of things I use in my daily life…. I don&amp;#39;t really use the computer to game much so IDK what to put in as my gaming software.&#xA;I mainly write my code in the terminal with either neovim or helix (Shoutout silt) or Emacs for taking notes and such. In fact this site was made using Org mode!&#xA;I have a pretty good Neovim config I am proud of.</description>

      <description>Hoi I Am FKF.&#xA;I&amp;#39;m a random 19 year old programmer.&#xA;Uhh…..IDK what else to say……&#xA;I like music…..but I suppose most people do. Though my taste in music is a bit…odd to say the least.&#xA;I do like to read though. Mainly fiction…. I also like to read Korean comic books AKA Manhwas. Though nowadays I don&amp;#39;t really have the time to read because I am busy often.</description>
