aaaaaaaaaa Hoi I Am FKF.

I\'m a random 19 year old programmer.

Uhh.....IDK what else to say......

I like music.....but I suppose most people do. Though my taste in music
is a bit...odd to say the least.

I do like to read though. Mainly fiction.... I also like to read Korean
comic books AKA Manhwas. Though nowadays I don\'t really have the time
to read because I am busy often.

I do like to write code as much as possible. Mainly low level languages
like C (C++ is a vile abomination).

I don\'t really use social media other than discord and bluesky

Writing this site in org mode + hugo + no markdown because I am sigma
and skibidi like that :3
